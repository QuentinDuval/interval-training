# Interval Training Timer

Hosted at: https://quentinduval.github.io/interval-training/index.html

A basic timer for interval training, allowing to configure the number of rounds, the duration of each round and the rest time between rounds.

Inspired from https://fitlb.com/tabata-timer, but focused on my needs, and with the possibility to switch the colors between rounds and customize the colors.


## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode. The page will reload if you make edits. You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
